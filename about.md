Hi, I'm d1d4c71c, a hacker from somewhere in the PNW in the USA. I've been doing IT and hacking stuff since the 1980s. 
This site is where I plan to drop various bits of info, notes, and the occasional rant.

The reason why I'm doing this under a pseudonym is because I'm kind of sick of the attention economy - not that
all the influencers in the hacking scene are bad, far from it...I just don't want to participate in that 
thing, and don't want to worry about "monetizing" or really caring about viewership or having parasocial
relationships with people I don't actually know.

So, if you find value, that's good enough for me. I hope you do.
